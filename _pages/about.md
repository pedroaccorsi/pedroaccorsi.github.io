I am an Assistant Professor at the [Institute of Political Science](https://cienciapolitica.uc.cl/), [Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile](https://www.uc.cl/).

My research focuses on international conflict and civil-military relations. I study military power, battlefield performance, and the causes, consequences, and measurement of armed conflict. Within civil-military relations, I work on public opinion, the establishment (or erosion) of civilian control over the military, and defense policy and reform. I'm also interested in conceptual and measurement questions. My research is published in academic journals including *Comparative Political Studies*, *Security Studies*, and *Armed Forces & Society*.

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow (2023–25) and Hans J. Morgenthau Fellow (2021–22) at the [Notre Dame International Security Center](https://ndisc.nd.edu/), [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), and served as Managing Editor of [*Security Studies*](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/fsst20) (2020–22). I received my Ph.D. in [Political Science](https://cla.umn.edu/polisci) from the [University of Minnesota](https://www.umn.edu/) in 2023.
